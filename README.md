# Learn-Everyday - Android app

Learn something new everyday while waiting on the bus, train, in queue - you name it!
This app will let you browse random Wikipedia pages in an intuitive and beautiful way, with inspiration taken from the well known Flipboard app. 

Supports English, German, French, and Norwegian.
